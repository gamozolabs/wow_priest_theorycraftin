# Readme

Oh god why are you here. I write absurd code which I can brute force because I
throw enough cores at the problem.

Ultimately with this project you can set up sets of items, and it'll brute
force all possible combinations of those items and enchants. You then can make
whatever fitness function (you gotta write the code) and you can see which
outfits are best for your desires. So far it just tracks max mana, healing,
health, and healing-until-oom. It's quite healer-centric.

There's some bundled data for an undead 29s twink priest.
